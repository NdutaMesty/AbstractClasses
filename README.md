# Abstract Classes
We are learning about Abstract classes.


*An abstract class* is a class that cannot be instantiated. However, you can create classes that inherit from an abstract class.
Typically, you use an abstract class to create a blueprint for other classes.

Similarly, an abstract method is an method without an implementation. 
An abstract class may or may not include abstract methods.

To define an abstract class, you use the abc (abstract base class) module.
